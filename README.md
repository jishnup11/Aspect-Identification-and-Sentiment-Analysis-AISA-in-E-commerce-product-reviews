# Aspect-Identification-and-Sentiment-Analysis-AISA-in-E-commerce-product-reviews

Understanding customer sentiments are important in marketing strategies. Understanding people’s emotions is essential for businesses since customers are able to express their thoughts and feelings more openly than ever before.This project is to understand the customer reviews of women's clothing on E-commerce and to classify each review whether it consists of positive and negative. We also develop a method for performing aspect-based sentiment analysis based on VADER Sentiment analysis tool, a sentence-level sentiment analysis algorithm built for sentiment analysis of social media and determining the sentiment of each aspect. We implemented a bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) with the long-short term memory unit(LSTM) for sentiment classification.
